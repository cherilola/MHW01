;;; Procedure: turtle-centered-polygon!
;;;  
;;; Parameters: turtle, a turtle
;;;             radius, a number
;;;             sides, a integer
;;; Purpose:
;;;   Draws a polygon with a desired number of sides and a desired size around turtle's original position.
;;; Produces:
;;;   poly, a side effect
;;; Preconditions:
;;;   radius > 0
;;;   sides > 2
;;; Postconditions:
;;;   When sides = 2, produces a line.
;;;   Poly is oriented so at least one corner has the same row value as the turtle's original position.

;(let ((interior-angle (/ (* 180 (- sides 2)) sides)))
;;;; defines interior-angle as the value of that expression for the duration of the procedure
;  (turtle-up! turtle)
;;;; the turtle picks up the brush so that it can move to the edge of the polygon without drawing a line
;  (turtle-forward! turtle radius)
;;;; moves the turtle to the edge of the polygon so it can begin drawing
;  (turtle-down! turtle)
;;;; allows the turtle to begin drawing
;  (turtle-turn! turtle (- 180 (/ interior-angle 2)))
;;;; turns the turtle half the interior angle plus the exterior angle
;  (turtle-polygon! turtle (* 2 radius (sin (/ pi sides))) sides)
;;;; uses the earlier-defined turtle-polygon procedure to draw a polygon with an appropriate side length,
;;;; which it gets by trigonometry. The radius inputed are two sides of a right triangle that has the
;;;; side-length as its hypotenuse.
;  (turtle-turn! turtle (/ interior-angle 2))
;;;; turtle-polygon! returns the turtle to the original orientation, which in this case is half the
;;;; interior angle plus the exeterior angle-- this turns it by another half of the interior angle. Since
;;;; the exeterior angle and the interior angle add up to 180, this returns it to the turtle's beginning
;;;; orientation, except facing the opposite direction (if the turtle was facing right at the beginning
;;;; of the procedure, it is now facing left). This turns the turtle towards the center. 
;  (turtle-up! turtle)
;;;; stops the turtle from drawing so it can return to the center of the polygon incognito.
;  (turtle-forward! turtle radius)
;;;; moves the turtle to the center of the polygon
;  (turtle-turn! turtle 180)
;;;; turns the turtle back to its original orientation.
;  (turtle-down! turtle))))
;;;; puts the turtle's brush back down
